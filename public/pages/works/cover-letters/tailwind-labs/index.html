    hi, my name's sammy, and im happy to have the opportunity to apply to
    <strong>tailwind labs</strong> as a <em>design engineer</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    i always appreciate these cover letters as a place to reflect and ponder on
    my past, as well as think about my future. and so i'd like to start on a
    project i've done in the past (albeit recent past haha)
  </p>
  <h2>
    websites as outreach materials (<a
      href="https://github.com/bonnysystems/website/tree/main/src/pages/outreach"
      target="_blank"
      >github</a
    >)
  </h2>
  <p>
    i've been in the process of building my own business,
    <a href="https://bonny.systems">bonny systems</a>. i offer a variety of
    software development services, mainly in the realm of web development.
    whether it's enhancing the performance of your website, or making sure that
    your website is accessible, i really try to focus on building beautiful,
    long-lasting websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    i wanted to outreach to local businesses nearby that i realized don't have
    the best performing websites. but how do i do this in a meaningful,
    impactful way, without exerting too much time into each client? essentially,
    how do i most efficiently outreach to these local businesses in a meaningful
    way?
  </p>
  <p>
    i didnt want to print out pieces of paper and hand deliver it with the
    business cards to businesses. that would have felt like a waste. so how
    about if i were to... create websites? websites? yes! the core service of my
    business perhaps is the key to my answer. and after going through with it,
    it really was a success.
  </p>
  <p>
    this is how it worked: using astro.js, i create an html page that takes in a
    variety of data (i.e. frontmatter) and then displays it in a nicely
    designed, easy-to-understand page. here's an example of how one looks like:
    <a href="https://bonny.systems/outreach/djy9">bonny.systems/outreach/djy9</a
    >. i would attach a sticky note to the back of my business card with a URL
    to the website. customers could then type in the URL and voila, a way to
    outreach to potential clients without needing to waste paper and ink.
  </p>
  <p>
    there are many improvements this method could take. one is that instead of a
    URL, just have a QR code. the issue of not wasting paper and ink come to the
    foray, but perhaps there are more efficient ways to do that as well.
    regardless, using websites as outreach materials was a fun and successful
    manner to outreach to these local businesses.
  </p>
  <h2>teaching while asking friends for input</h2>
  <p>
    while i was working on this, i asked several people from my community
    discord server for their input. it's a place where my programmer friends and
    i (over 15+ members) talk about new things in the industry that intrigue us,
    feedback on projects, and just in general a place for us to all nerd out.
    it's a great place for friends of mine that are getting into programming to
    learn, as well as a way for the more experienced ones to learn how to teach!
  </p>
  <p>
    that's something that has been so precious to me from the community. when i
    explain a project im working on and go into the nitty gritty, it really
    exposes what i know and what i dont know. in doing that within my discord
    server, that's made me realize how much i also just love teaching. because
    not only am i helping my friends whom i want to help, but also it helps me
    solidify what i know and really checks me!
  </p>
  <p>
    i have experience of teaching from the various times i volunteered at
    <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/">code in place</a>, stanford
    university's "free, human-centered, intro-to-coding course." i volunteered
    there twice, once during covid in 2019 and another last year in 2023. it's
    been a great place again for me to help those who want to learn how to
    program, while also discovering new ways of thinking about programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    i have found it immensely powerful to find new ways to re-learn and think
    about what basic, fundamental programming concepts are. for example, how do
    you visually teach someone what a variable is? how can we use visuals to
    help understand what a variable is in a concrete, easy-to-understand manner?
    what potential questions can students ask that i should be prepared for?
    what biases am i having when creating these teaching examples that i may not
    even realize?
  </p>
  <p>
    these questions and more are what make teaching so much fun. in a way,
    teaching is very similar to programming. having to understand the student as
    opposed to the computer, and trying to think outside the box for solutions
    (or teaching methods) that i've never thought of before.
  </p>
  <h2>the jump</h2>
  <p>
    whenever i have the opportunity to pair my love for programming with my
    desire to teach, i jump at the opportunity. which is why
    <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/careers/design-engineer">this position</a>
    made so much sense to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    whether it's designing prototype features, creating components, or teaching
    audiences all about them, each and every one of those gets me so excited
    since im practically already doing things similar to that!
  </p>
  <p>
    i believe firmly in what tailwind labs is trying to do. it's love for the
    web runs deep, similar to mine. i'd love to have the opportunity to be the
    person that designs and engineers these experiences with those that share
    the same values :)

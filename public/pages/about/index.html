  <p>hi, my name is sammy samkough :)</p>
  <p>
    i was born in new jersey, usa, on march 17 1998 (my freckles are proof of
    this)
  </p>
  <p>
    i am a first-generation american syrian circassian. my parents were born in
    syria, and specifically come from the golan heights. before that, my
    ancestors were living in "circassia"
  </p>
  <p>
    i always struggle how to talk about myself. and for some reason, i always
    end up starting with this: i love my family. it is my main character trait,
    i suppose. when i say family, i dont <em>just</em> mean blood-related
    family. i also mean my found family ; people from high school, my local
    commmunity, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    it's hard to describe my love for my family. if i were to put it bluntly,
    you could say that i am literally <em>in love</em> with them. the feelings
    are immensely strong. i would do anything for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    other then my family, i love pizza, eating food, the web (internet),
    watching movies, reading books, watching shows (aka the sopranos), playing
    soccer, adventuring / traveling, cuddling with my mama. there's a lot more i
    love but those are it for now

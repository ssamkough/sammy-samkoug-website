<div class="reading-block">
  <p>hi, my name is sammy samkough :)</p>
  <p>
    born and raised in new jersey (usa), i still operate from here, commuting to
    new york city regularly for recreation and work
  </p>
  <p>
    for the past 5+ years i have worked as a software engineer in a variety of
    positions. at popstar i worked as a swift engineer with a team of 3, while
    at canal i was a full-stack frontend-focused engineer with a team of 50
  </p>
  <p>
    i am now at a point where im looking for what i want next in my career. here
    are some attributes that are "ideal" but not strict in what im looking for:
  </p>
  <h3>company</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      industries:
      <ul>
        <li>solar / climate</li>
        <li>dev tools / internal software</li>
        <li>charity / nonprofit</li>
        <li>magazine / issues</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>team size: 50ish, not too big and not too small</li>
    <li>company's profitable</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>role</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>fully remote</li>
    <li>frontend or full-stack</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    again these are "ideal" and not strict. for instance, i am open to a hybrid
    role where i commute to nyc. or for a company in it's seed stage. it all
    depends on the team, the product, and the context.
